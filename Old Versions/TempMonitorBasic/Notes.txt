 Reads DS18B20 sensors and OPI cables for grain bin monitoring. Uses wifi to connect to a PC with the server program. Edit the sketch to enter network name, network password and IP of the PC.

 I have used it on the Sparkfun 'Thing', 'Thing Dev' and the WEMOS D1 Mini Pro (https://universal-solder.ca/product/wemos-d1-mini-pro-16mb-esp8266-wifi-arduino-lua-nodemcu-antenna/). I have used them without the external antenna with good results.

 For OPI cables I used 2 pin connectors (https://www.amazon.ca/TING-Waterproof-Electrical-Connector-Pigtail/dp/B00UFICM5I). Connect red to ground. Connect black to a signal pin. connect a 2.2K ohm resistor between black and power.
